<p style="color:blue;font-size:200%;"> Practicing HTML is fun. <em>So far</em> we have that help us describe how we want our webpage to look. We have tried the head,
title, H(heading) and paragraph tags so far. Very few people know all the tags in HTML, but that is okay because we can do a lot with just some basic tags.
We can learn about new tags when we need them. </p>
